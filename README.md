<h1>Zafferano</h1>

<h3>Zafferano is a diary for your recipes. Track your habits and get inspired.</h3>

<h2>What is Zafferano (again)?</h2>
<p>Zafferano allows you to explore new recipes and add them as entries for each day.  </p>
<p>This is sort of like having a diary for your eating habits without any negative connotations coming with the term "eating habits".</p>
<p>You learn what to buy, in what quantities, and how to prepare your favourite meals - no guilt-inducing tables and stats.</p>
<p><b>This is just a concept for an application built in NextJS. It offers no login capabilities, and all dashboard entries appearing within the app are collected thanks to collective interest, in relative anonymity.</b></p> 
 <p><b>In other words, the data you submit will be visible to others, though no specific personal data are collected here. It shouldn't be enough to make anyone 'identifiable'.</b></p>

<h2>What does Zafferano use?</h2>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript</li>
<li>NextJS</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<!-- MEMO I can't remember but needs to be updated -->
<li>An external API endpoint provided by [XXX]</li>
</ul>

<h2>What does Zafferano even mean?</h2>
<p>It means <i>saffron</i> in Italian. Thought it sounded quite nice.</p>

<h2>What is the future of Zafferano?</h2>
<p>Zafferano is a personal (pet) project specifically meant to implement Typescript and NextJS's full-stack architecture. </p>
<p>It currently offers a diary module, though two other modules - 'Favourites' and 'Discovery' are in the works.</p>
